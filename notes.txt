L03 - Binary vs Linear

/*
DISCO:
  - We ran into memory errors when we set the numOfArrayTests to 30 and counter to 1000.
  - We ran into errors while using "=="" instead of compareTo.
QCC:
  - Does the hypothesis we are testing also refer to arrays with random elements? If so, would we also include the sorting process in the time elapsed?

GALLERY TOUR:
    CNN:
        * Used different array lengths (1 - 1 * 10^9)
        * Random target
        * Ascending, ordered array
        * No heap size error
        * Run each array test 1000 times
        * Time recorded total time for 1000 hours
    Big Apples:
        * Tested large, small arrays.
        * Selected indices
        * Extra "for" loop vs "while" loop
        * Larger time for longer arrays
        * Binary search faster for smaller indices
        * Linear relationship for linear search
        * Tested each array search function 3 times to find average time.
        * Averaged to find a true value
    Strawberry Jam:
        * 10000 times, array size 1000 - 10^6
        * List size 1000 weird case binary was slower (initial lag)
        * Linear increases linearly (shocking)
        * Worst case scenario (target selected manually)
