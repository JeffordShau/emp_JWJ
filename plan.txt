Do this 21 times:
  Start at array length 1
  Generate normal array with elements in increasing order
  - The elements in the generated array will be used to test the two methods
  - Elements are already sorted for Binary Search
  For both Binary and Linear Search methods:
    1. Store start time
    2. Search for random values of elements in the array. 
    3. When value is found, store stop time.
    4. Subtract and display the difference in time. 
    5. Multiply array length by 2 and repeat.
