Do this 21 times:
  Start at array length 1
  Generate normal array, filled with random elements
  - The elements in the generated array will be used to test the two methods
  - Elements will be sorted when running Binary Search
  For both Binary and Linear Search methods:
    1. Store start time
    2. Search for both random and selected values of elements in the array. Also search for both selected and random values of elements not present in the array.
    3. When value is found or not found, store stop time
    4. Subtract and store difference in timestamps array
    5. Multiply array length by 2 and repeat.
