Do this 21 times:
  Start at array length 1
  Generate normal array, filled with random elements
  Generate worst case scenario array, all elements in increasing order
  For both arrays:
    Store start time
    Search for random value
    When value is found, store stop time
    Subtract and store in timestamps array
  Multiply array length by 2 and go back to top.
